I'm a PhD student at the School of Criminology, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.
My research interests involve co-offending; crime trends and criminal populations; illegal drug markets, violence, and epidemiology of crime; social network theory and analyis; data and measurement issues.
